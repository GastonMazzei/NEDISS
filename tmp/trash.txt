[warning] We currently rely heavily on the long -> int conversion which during compilation raises warnings of being implementation-defined. Two important lines are:    
(1) 'rank = in_degree(*v, g) + out_degree(*v, g);' and
(2) 'NLocals = neighbors.second - neighbors.first;'

WE WERE OVERRR



We effectively answered asynchronously a vertex info request :-)
ENDing answer_messages. Caught (R_tot)=1 requests, Answered (R_send)=1.

Before being ready, we waited for 65 laps!
We effectively captured a vertex info request :-)
Just sent a message with status 0
Already checking if everyone is over, proc 1, ready size is: 0, here comes the ALL2ALL

ANSWERED ONE MESSAGE!
P1 says that everyone is over! flags list is 1 1 1
Answering 1 with 0's value, which is 12.345000
