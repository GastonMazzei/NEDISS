  Network Diffusion & Synchronization Simulator



[warning] We currently rely heavily on the long -> int conversion which during compilation raises warnings of being implementation-defined. Two important lines are:    
(1) 'rank = in_degree(*v, g) + out_degree(*v, g);' and
(2) 'NLocals = neighbors.second - neighbors.first;'
